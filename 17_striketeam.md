**A process map of the claimant and employee experience of an unemployment claim, including, but not limited to:**
*   Applying for “regular” UI
*   Applying for PUA
*   The process map(s) should include:
    *   Names of underlying systems
    *   Error rates
    *   Volume rates
    *   Processing times (e.g. this task takes, on average, 6 minutes)
    *   Wait times (e.g. this task waits, on average, 6 days to be completed)
    *   Type of employee who can complete a step and number of these employees, as applicable
    *   Escape hatches
        *   Ways escape hatch can be exploited and mitigating factors
        *   Also note absent escape hatches

**An instrumented dashboard that calculates backlog at least once per day.**
*   Definition should be **shared** across sites and determined by U.S. DOL, though the underlying math will differ (could start with CA strike team definition)
*   This must have clear differentiation by claimant (e.g. one claimant can only count in the backlog once)

**A workload management tool that enables leadership to work down claims most efficiently.**
*   This can be a software tool or a spreadsheet
*   Each step should include:
    *   Average time to complete step
    *   Volume of claims in this step (# of pending tasks)
    *   Number of available employees who can complete this task (averaging in average attendance)
    *   Number of assigned employees
*   Steps must consider dependencies (e.g. if Step 2 follows Step 1, all claims that complete Step 1 on Monday should appear in Tuesday’s workload for Step 2)

**A proposed mechanism for capturing and monitoring equitable outcomes (e.g. race, ethnicity, gender, age).**

**An initial plan for how the agency can realistically add automation and elastic resources to scale capacity up/down (with numbers).**

**An analysis of what, if any, shared service(s) the state does or could benefit from.**
*   For existing shared services, details on what needs to be improved for it to be effective
*   For non-existent shared services, details on what it needs to do, and how the state would integrate with it

**An initial plan for how the agency can define and concretely, automatically measure success in terms of benefits delivery for claimants (accuracy, timeliness, and equitable access), fraud reduction, and elastic capacity.**
