Only 13% of government software projects over US$6m succeed.[^105] Both before and during the pandemic, news media has repeatedly reported on costly state unemployment insurance systems across the country — California, Florida, Massachusetts, Indiana, Pennsylvania — that went over budget, over time, resulted in lawsuits, and most importantly, failed constituents in need.[^106] 

## The Federal Cost Estimator is a helpful tool for procuring services.
The [Contract-Awarded Labor Category (CALC) tool](https://calc.gsa.gov/) helps federal contracting officers and others find awarded prices to use in negotiations for labor contracts. It offers ceiling prices, fully burdened costs, services data, and worldwide rates. This tool shows actual ceiling prices awarded to various vendors at the master contract level, on the 8 eight GSA professional services schedules (including IT 70).

These are not  prices paid at the task order level, which may be slightly different (e.g., to reflect a discount).
Rates you see in CALC are:
* Fully burdened hourly rates
* Ceiling prices (awarded at the master contract level)
* For the current fiscal year
* Worldwide awarded rates
