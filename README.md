# A Playbook for Improving Unemployment Insurance Delivery
You can access the report on [improveunemployment.com](https://improveunemployment.com/), or see the project [on the New America landing page](https://www.newamerica.org/new-practice-lab/playbook/improve-unemployment/).

### About the Playbook
This playbook presents a bold yet achievable North Star vision for what unemployment benefits can be, and the concrete steps needed to get there — concrete steps that, in almost every case, individual states have already tested.

To create the vision and map the steps, we collaborated with more than 50 advocacy groups, partners, dozens of state leaders and many unemployed workers. We highlight lessons learned from past recessions, recent pandemic-inspired innovations, and complementary benefit spaces like SNAP and WIC.

### This is a playbook of what’s working to deliver unemployment benefits to those who need them.
We hope that this living playbook will inspire and drive further improvements, building on the successes of individual states. New America, supported by the Families and Workers Fund, will continue to update these pages as states develop more solutions. We invite you to submit your suggestions and stories here.
