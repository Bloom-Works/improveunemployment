Claimants can file an appeal when they believe that the unemployment system has falsely denied them benefits or the ability to apply for benefits. Most states have 2levels of appeals.


## An electronic appeals tracking system can provide valuable information.
Ideally, states have an appeals tracking system that: 
*   Accepts electronic appeals filing
*   Provides a plain language status update about the appeal
*   Allows for reporting based on appeal reason 

Short of this, we recommend at least using a dedicated mailing address for appeals and counting appeals by mail piece or by weight.[^119]


### Volume and types of appeals are an important early indicator.
We recommend states keep a close watch on their appeals rates for any potential impact from other, upstream changes. Closely tracking the rate of appeals relative to claim volume is a critical early indicator that your attempts at thwarting fraud are diverting real claimants.

We also recommend that states review data on appeals rates — both raw volume and trends — in their [integrated command centers](#bookmark=id.j9deu76xsjtw).
