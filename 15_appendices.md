## Draft Ecosystem Assessment Criteria
**This could be collected in a spreadsheet with a dynamic dashboard on top, so DOL could view things like % of states with/without mobile application views, and click to drill in. [5-minute MVP link here](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=85891460239e494b8c2811a8c7e56ff1).**

DOL may be able to conduct this survey without Paperwork Reduction Act clearance per [p55](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr748/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf) of the CARES Act.

We recommend piloting the survey with 3 to 5 states before collecting additional data. This will allow you to identify any missing questions or confusing wording.
